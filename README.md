# Multi-level-Encryption-Ideation
Multi Level Encryption is a security-oriented Ideation project designed to provide a robust and multi-layered encryption mechanism for sensitive data. The project employs a combination of AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) algorithms to ensure both symmetric and asymmetric encryption.
